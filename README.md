## Restaurant reservation app

To enter the user's personal account, you must register or enter an existing profile. This feature is implemented using authentication of Firebase. After that, a tab with current bookings will be available with the ability to edit and delete. If there is one hour left before the start of the booking time, then the possibility of editing and deleting disappears. After the start time of the booking has expired, it is archived. There is also a tab where you can create a booking: select the date, time, table and, if necessary, specify a comment. A table may not be available for selection if there is already a reservation in the database for that time. Firebase is used to receive and write data. The ability to edit the profile is also available: change the name, email or password.
